Here's what the above is doing:
    1. Selects all accordion containers, contents, and icons
    2. Hides all accordion contents
    3. Adds an event listener to each accordion container
    4. When an accordion container is clicked, it:
        - Hides all accordion contents
        - Resets all icon transforms to 0deg (default)
        - Checks if this container has class 'accordion-open'
            - If it does, it removes class 'accordion-open'
            - If it doesn't, it:
                - Removes class 'accordion-open' from all containers
                - Adds class 'accordion-open' to this container
                - Shows accordion content
                - Rotates accordion icon 180deg
